# üìö BookstoreDB ‚Äì MySQL Database Project

This project is a **MySQL database design and implementation** for a fictional bookstore's operations. It was created as part of a group assignment to demonstrate real-world skills in database schema design, data population, and user access control.

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Design a relational database to manage a bookstore‚Äôs data
- Create all necessary tables with appropriate relationships
- Populate the database with sample data for books, authors, customers, and orders
- Implement access control for group members using MySQL user privileges

## üß™ Sample Data

- Includes 10  **Kenyan customers**
- 10+ **books by local authors**
- Fully connected order history, address info, and shipping details

## üîê User Access Control

Two users were created with remote IP access:

```sql
CREATE USER 'admin1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';
CREATE USER 'admin2'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password2';

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON BookstoreDB.* TO 'admin1'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON BookstoreDB.* TO 'admin2'@'%';
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Import the `bookstore_project.sql` file into your MySQL server:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < bookstore_project.sql
   ```

2. Make sure to allow connections from the group members' IP addresses.

3. Use any SQL client or MySQL CLI to query the data.
